# HackAZ2017
Rigoberto Lara, Saul Perez, Alejandro Robles, Andrew Seale 
This is our HackAZ 2017 project.  We are creating a website that determines how long a person will probably be single based on the
websites they frequent, time spent outside, race, gender, etc., and then calculates the duration of singleness based on that.
